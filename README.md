# Gameplay
A sound drone is playing in the background. The user will be a blob and as the game starts, the sidescroll starts. As blocks appear, the blob can jump on them, which will trigger different sounds that add a melody to the sound drone. With each block hit, the background color will change as well. Bonus: there will be blocks occasionally to take off the last sounds added. There will be a reset button at the top if the user wants to start the sounds over at anytime.

# Implementation Timeline
Day 1: Setup Node modules and webpack. Create basic file structure and entry file. Get familiar with the API's I will be implementing and learn how to make this project.

Day 2: Build basic background element. 

Day 3: Create logic and backend. Add audio files and connect them to have interaction triggers. 

Day 4: Install user controls. Make sure everything is in working order and final polishing.
